<h2>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_pollution" title = "google">Water pollution (or aquatic pollution)</a> is the contamination of water bodies, usually as a result of 
human activities, in such a manner that negatively affects its legitimate uses.Water pollution reduces the ability of the body of water 
to provide the ecosystem services that it would otherwise provide. Water bodies include for example lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers, 
reservoirs and groundwater. Water pollution results when contaminants are introduced into these water bodies. Water pollution can 
usually be attributed to one of four sources: sewage, industry, agriculture, and urban runoff including stormwater.For example,
releasing inadequately treated wastewater into natural waters can lead to degradation of these aquatic ecosystems. Water pollution can 
also lead to water-borne diseases for people using polluted water for drinking, bathing, washing or irrigation.Supplying clean drinking 
water is an important ecosystem service provided by some freshwater systems, but approximately 785 million people in the world do not 
have access to clean drinking water because of pollution.
